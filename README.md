Figure 1: Overview of our framework
</p>

Recent progress in multi-turn RL has significantly improved reasoning LLMs' performances on complex interactive tasks. Despite advances in stabilization techniques such as fine-grained credit assignment and trajectory filtering, instability remains pervasive and often leads to training collapse.
We argue that this instability stems from inefficient exploration in multi-turn settings, where policies continue to generate low-information actions that neither reduce uncertainty nor advance task progress.

To address this issue, we propose Token- and Turn-level Policy Optimization (T^2PO), an uncertainty-aware framework that explicitly controls exploration at fine-grained levels.

## Our Framework Design

- At the token level, (T^2PO) monitors uncertainty dynamics and triggers a thinking intervention once  the marginal uncertainty change falls below a threshold. 

- At the turn level, (T^2PO) identifies interactions with negligible exploration progress and dynamically resamples such turns to avoid wasted rollouts. 

- We evaluate (T^2PO) in diverse environments, including WebShop, ALFWorld, and Search QA, demonstrating substantial gains in training stability and performance improvements with better exploration efficiency.

### 🔥 Key Features

## 🌊 Easy Extension

🔹 All of the methods utilized is in `recipe`, you can warp the verl worker for your code to join our codebase. The folder under `recipe` can represent either a method for different tasks or a series methods for one task. You can refer to [Easy Extension](docs/extension.md) for examples.

🔹 All of the environments utilized is in `agent_system`, you can warp the env for your code to join our codebase.

🔹 Add specific dependencies to `requirements_xxx.txt`

🔹 Feel free to add the folder of the third-party tools, e.g., `AgentRL/sandbox` for code implementation.
