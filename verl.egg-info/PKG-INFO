                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 👋 Hi, everyone! 
    We will tell the world open-source agentic RL area is suffering!
    <br>
    <br>
</div>


<h1 style="text-align: center;"> 🤖 Agentic RL Arena </h1>


<p align="center"><img src="public/ARL.png" width="800px" alt="Agentic RL Arena Framework" /></p>
<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
Figure 1: Overview of our framework
</p>

## Our Framework Design

- Our benchmark profoundly analyzes the existing sufferings of Agentic RL, including tool-intergrated and multi-turn RL.
- Our benchmark comprehensively compares existing Agentic RL algorithms and their breakthroughs.
- Our benchmark universally provides experimental results and findings on multiple ARC tasks.

### 🔥 Key Features

- ✅ Support Training Multi-turn Math+Code Interpreter Agents
- ✅ Support Training Multi-turn Embody Agents
- ✅ Support Training Multi-turn Search Agents
- ✅ Support Training Multi-turn Multi-modal Game Agents
- ✅ Support Training Multi-turn Web Agents
- ✅ Support Evaluating Commerical LLMs as Agents

### 🔧 Upcoming Features and Changes

- ➡️ Support Software Enginnering Agents

### 📅 TODO

- [ ] Cross-domain agentic reasoning
- [ ] Multiple tool integration reasoning
- [ ] Gap between $\pi_{\theta_{vLLM}}$ and $\pi_{\theta_{FSDP}}$
- [ ] Turn-level rollout compactness
- [ ] Rollout analysis

## 💡 Getting Started


Our benchmark is based on the following main dependencies:

```python
Python=3.11, VeRL=0.4.0, PyTorch=2.6.0, and vLLM=0.8.5
```

<!-- You can install other requirements as follows:
``` bash
# Install conda (Optional if conda exists)
bash set_conda.sh

# Install foundational dependencies 
bash setup_env.sh

# Install dependencies for specific tasks

pip install -r requirements_xxx.txts
``` -->

## 🌊 Easy Extension

🔹 All of the methods utilized is in `recipe`, you can warp the verl worker for your code to join our codebase. The folder under `recipe` can represent either a method for different tasks or a series methods for one task. You can refer to [Easy Extension](docs/extension.md) for examples.

🔹 All of the environments utilized is in `agent_system`, you can warp the env for your code to join our codebase.

🔹 Add specific dependencies to `requirements_xxx.txt`

🔹 Feel free to add the folder of the third-party tools, e.g., `AgentRL/sandbox` for code implementation.
